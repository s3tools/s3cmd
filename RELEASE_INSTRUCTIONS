Instructions for s3cmd maintainers for doing a tagged release and publishing on sourceforge.net.
In the below, 1.5.0-rc1 is the example version being released.  Salt to taste.

1.  Make a fresh clone of the repo:
   git clone ssh+git://git@github.com/s3tools/s3cmd s3cmd-release

2.  Run ./run-tests.py to verify it all works OK.

3.  Update version to 1.5.0-rc1 in S3/PkgInfo.py

4.  Update manpage with ./s3cmd --help | ./format-manpage.pl > s3cmd.1

5.  Update NEWS with info about new features. Best to extract from git
    with:  git log --no-merges v1.5.0-beta1..
    (list all tags with: "git tag")


6.  Verify the above changes:
    git diff --check && git diff
    git status
    (The only changed files should be NEWS, s3cmd.1, S3/PkgInfo.py)

7.  Remove testsuite (intentionally inaccessible files break the next
    step):
    chmod -R +rwx testsuite/permission-tests/permission-denied-dir && rm -rf testsuite

8.  If everything worked fine commit the above changes:
    git commit -a -m "Update version to 1.5.0-rc1"

9. Tag it:
    git tag --sign -a v1.5.0-rc1 -m "Tag v1.5.0-rc1"

10. Push back to github:
    git push --tags

11.  Build the "Source Distribution":
    python setup.py sdist upload --sign
    -> Creates dist/s3cmd-1.5.0-rc1.tar.gz* and dist/s3cmd-1.5.0-rc1.zip*

The upload step publishes it to PyPi, so 'pip install s3cmd' downloads
the new version.  It also generated the GPG signatures, so you don't
have to do that manually, and have them available for the next steps.


GitHub releases

1. Login to github.com/s3tools/s3cmd

2.  You will see your new tag in the Tags tab.  Click "Draft a new
    release".

3.  In the 'Tag version' drop-down, select your new tag.

4.  In the 'Release title' field, name it v1.5.0-rc1.

5.  In the 'Describe this release' text box, add in this release's
    notes from the NEWS file.

6.  Upload all 4 files from dist/.

7.  Click "Publish release"



SourceForge releases

1.  Login to sf.net

2.  Go to https://sourceforge.net/p/s3tools/admin/

3.  Files -> s3cmd -> Add Folder -> Enter "1.5.0-rc1" -> Create

4.  Go into 1.5.0-rc1 -> Add File -> upload dist/s3cmd-1.5.0-rc1.tar.gz

5.  Once uploaded click the little "i" icon on the right and click
    "Select all" under "Default Download For:" to update the default
    download button to this new version.

6.  Give it a few minutes and verify on the Summary page that the
    download button has been updated to s3cmd-1.5.0-rc1.tar.gz

Now it's time to send out an announcement email to
s3cmd-announce@lists.sourceforge.net and
s3cmd-general@lists.sourceforge.net (check out the s3cmd-announce
archive for an inspiration :)

And the last step is to ask the respective distribution maintainers
(Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, OpenSuse, ...?) to update the package in
their builds.
