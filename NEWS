* Increased socket_timeout from 10 secs to 5 mins.
* Added "Static WebSite" support [ws-create / ws-delete / ws-info]
  (contributed by Jens Braeuer)
* Force MIME type with --mime-type=abc/xyz, also --guess-mime-type
  is now on by default, -M is no longer shorthand for --guess-mime-type
* Allow parameters in MIME types, for example:
  --mime-type="text/plain; charset=utf-8"
* MIME type can be guessed by python-magic which is a lot better than
  relying on the extension. Contributed by Karsten Sperling.

  Listing buckets requires the S3 ListAllMyBuckets permission which
  is typically not available to delegated IAM accounts. With this change,
  s3cmd --configure accepts an (optional) bucket uri as a parameter
  and if it's provided, the access check will just verify access to this
  bucket individually. Contributed by Mike Repass.
* Allow STDOUT as a destination even for downloading multiple files.
  They will be output one after another without any delimiters!
  Contributed by Rob Wills.
