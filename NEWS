s3cmd 1.5.0   -   ???

  (Matt Domsch)

* Improved symlink-loop detection (Michal Ludvig)
* Add --delete-after option for sync (Matt Domsch)
* Handle empty return bodies when processing S3 errors.
  (Kelly McLaughlin)

* Updated bucket locations (Stefhen Hovland)
* Support custom HTTP headers (Brendan O'Connor, Karl Matthias)
* Improved MIME support (Karsten Sperling, Christopher Noyes)
* Added support for --acl-grant/--acl-revoke to 'sync' command
  (Michael Tyson)
* CloudFront: Support default index and default root invalidation
  (Josep del Rio)
* Command line options for access/secret keys (Matt Sweeney)

s3cmd 1.1.0   -   (never released)
===========
* MultiPart upload enabled for both [put] and [sync]. Default chunk
  size is 15MB.
* CloudFront invalidation via [sync --cf-invalidate] and [cfinvalinfo].
* Increased socket_timeout from 10 secs to 5 mins.
* Added "Static WebSite" support [ws-create / ws-delete / ws-info]
  (contributed by Jens Braeuer)
* Force MIME type with --mime-type=abc/xyz, also --guess-mime-type 
  is now on by default, -M is no longer shorthand for --guess-mime-type
* Allow parameters in MIME types, for example:
  --mime-type="text/plain; charset=utf-8"
* MIME type can be guessed by python-magic which is a lot better than
  relying on the extension. Contributed by Karsten Sperling.
* Support for environment variables as config values. For instance
  in ~/.s3cmd put "access_key=$S3_ACCESS_KEY". Contributed by Ori Bar.
* Support for --configure checking access to a specific bucket instead
  of listing all buckets.
  Listing buckets requires the S3 ListAllMyBuckets permission which
  is typically not available to delegated IAM accounts. With this change,
  s3cmd --configure accepts an (optional) bucket uri as a parameter
  and if it's provided, the access check will just verify access to this
  bucket individually. Contributed by Mike Repass.
* Allow STDOUT as a destination even for downloading multiple files.
  They will be output one after another without any delimiters!
  Contributed by Rob Wills.

  using [cfmodify --log]
* Added --acl-grant and --acl-revoke [Timothee Groleau]
* Allow s3:// URI as well as cf:// URI as a distribution
  name for most CloudFront related commands.
* Support for Reduced Redundancy Storage (--reduced-redundancy)
* Follow symlinks in [put] and [sync] with --follow-symlinks
* Support for CloudFront DefaultRootObject [Luke Andrew]
